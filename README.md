First of all, clone the repository into vs code.

To run the system, open 2 terminals in vs code and make sure ports 3000 and 3333 are available to use in your computer.

In the first terminal, run the following commands:
1. cd server
2. npm install
3. npm start

It is vital that the server is running in order for the system to function as expected.

In the second terminal, run the following commands:
1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm start

You can now access the application at http://localhost:3000/
